    "# Mediation Analysis\n",
    "Written by Jin Cheong & Luke Chang\n",
    "\n",
    "A mediation analysis is conducted when a researcher is interested in the **mechanism** underlying how variable X has an effect on variable Y. It attempts to make a causal inference that a direct effect might be better explained by an indirect effect through a mediating variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the instance below where X has an effect **c** on Y:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) $Y = \\beta_1 + c \\cdot X $\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, there may be a third variable **M** which mediates the effect of X on Y. In other words, the variable M is partially responsible for the effect X has on Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "ï¿¼To conduct a mediation analysis one estimates two additional models: 1) the effect of X on M, and 2) the effect of X *and* M on Y. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) $M = \\beta_2 + a \\cdot X $\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) $Y = \\beta_3 + c' \\cdot X + b \\cdot M $  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Now the direct effect of X on Y, denoted as **C**,can be broken down into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $c = a \\cdot b + c' $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ a \\cdot b $ is the indirect effect of X on Y via the mediator. \n",
    "$c'$ is the remaining direct effect of X on Y controlling for M.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship is depicted below.  Note that M and Y both also have error included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Question*** Why does X not have error included in the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "***Answer*** Because X is only a regressor not an outcome variable in the models and standard regression does not estimate error on regressors.  See [orthogonal regression](http://davegiles.blogspot.com/2014/11/orthogonal-regression-first-steps.html) for a technique that models error on both X and Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Figures/mediation1.png\",width=500,align='center'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here are a few examples of mediations. Can you think of more?\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The effect of failure on depressed feelings is mediated by internalization of failure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Effect of CBT treatment is mediated by changes in cognition. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Effect of food intake on weight gain is mediated by metabolism.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For more information there is a nice [tutorial](http://davidakenny.net/cm/mediate.htm) on mediation by David Kenny, one of the author's of the original mediation paper."
