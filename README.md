This gihub repository provides lab materials that accompany Psyc63 Experimental Study of Behavior at Dartmouth College.  Labs will consist of working through [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) that contain exercises in Python. It is highly encouraged to download and install [Anaconda Python 2.7](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for using iPython notebooks.
